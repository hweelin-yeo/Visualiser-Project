# Visualiser-Project
I'm thinking of creating visualisers for algorithms so users can see for themselves how algorithms work. 
Inspired by Python tutor, which saved my ass for CS 1110. 

Still an ongoing project!

I wish to do visualisers for the following algorithms (list is still ongoing):
- Selection Sort (Done)
- Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort
- Binary Search
(tbc!)
